#location_event_producer and location_event_consumer microservices
- The user locations are tracked from client mobiles and sent asynchronously to the Grpc server which also has the logic to act as a kafka producer.
- The Grpc message passing technique is used here since a lot of location data may be sent and Grpc will reduce the latency and be faster.

- The kafka is used to handle this traffic for pushing location data.  
- location_event_consumer microservice acts as the producer and location_event_consumer microservice acts as the consumer which then saves the data inot the DB.DeprecationWarning

- person microservice , connection microservice and location microservice are separated into independent microservices and use REST API to interact with the React Frontend Service.
- These microservices can improve their efficiency by using caches as way of lookup service for faster responses.
